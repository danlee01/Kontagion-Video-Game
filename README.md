# Kontagion-Video-Game
Blast away the bacteria before they destroy you!

You are an award-winning epidemiologist who has volunteered to **shrink** yourself to exterminate malicious bacteria. 
Each petri dish that you visit is populated with *pits* that spawn different types of bacteria. Your job is to blast away
the bacteria before they get out of control.

**BEWARE**: While most bacteria will wander aimlessly, a select few have mutated to aggressively pursue you.

## About
This project was an exercise in object-oriented programming. I struggled a lot in the beginning because I wanted to find a design where everything fit together like a puzzle. However, I learned that a perfect design is extremely difficult to find in most cases, and that "good enough" is sufficient when following the OOP paradigm. You can see my work in the 'Actor' and 'StudentWorld' classes.
